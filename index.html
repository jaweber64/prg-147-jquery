        <h1>Working With jQuery Effects</h1>
        <p>INTRUCTIONS: Create a web page that implements at least two separate jQuery Effects of your choice,
            using two different types of Event to trigger them. Please don't use the same Effects that I did,
            the same type of events are fine.</p>
        <p>Used last week's DOM assignment and modified it to use jQuery effects. Make sure you hover over
            thumbnail and/or name. Click thumnail or name to open panel, then re-click thumbnail or name to
            close panel.</p>
